function  [strr,Centroid, EquivDiameter, Eccentricity,Extent,MajorAxisLength,MinorAxisLength] = get_region_statsCR(labelimage)
% get region statistics, usually for cell regions
% Uses regionprops in Image Processing toolbox
%  returns: Centroid (nLbl,2)
%    and 3 more arrays of nLbl elements ('Scalar'):
%  'EquivDiameter' - Scalar; the diameter of a circle with the same area as the 
%   region. Computed as sqrt(4*Area/pi). 
% 'Eccentricity' - Scalar; the eccentricity of the ellipse that has the same 
%   second-moments as the region. The eccentricity is the ratio of the distance 
%   between the foci of the ellipse and its major axis length. 
%   The value is between 0 and 1. (0 and 1 are degenerate cases; an ellipse 
%   whose eccentricity is 0 is actually a circle, while an ellipse whose eccentricity 
%   is 1 is a line segment.) 
%  'Extent' - Scalar; the proportion of the pixels in the bounding box that are also in the 
%    region.  Computed as the Area divided by area of the bounding box. CR:
%    this will be a small number for funny shapes
% 
% input: labelimage: 2D image with connected regions labelled with indices
% output:
% strr: structure with all of the outputs,
% then many variables with obvious names.
% CR started 040903
