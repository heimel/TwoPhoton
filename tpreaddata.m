% TPREADDATA - Reads twophon data
%
%  [DATA, T] = TPREADDATA(RECORDS, INTERVALS, PIXELINDS, MODE, CHANNELS, OPT, VERBOSE)
%
%  Reads two photon data blocks.  TPREADDATA
%  allows the user to request data in specific time intervals
%  and at specific locations in the image.
%
%  RECORDS contain experiment info. check HELP TP_ORGANIZATION
%  INTERVALS is a matrix specifying time intervals to read,
%     each row specifies a time interval:
%     e.g., INTERVALS = [ 4 5 ; 6 7] indicates to read data
%     between 4 and 5 seconds and also between 6 and 7 seconds
%     time 0 is relative to the beginning of the scans in the
%     first record
%  PIXELINDS is a cell list specifying pixel indices to read
%     from the images.  Each entry should contain the
%     pixel indices for a given region.
%  MODE is the data mode.  It can be the following:
%     0 : Individidual pixel values are returned.
%     1 : Mean data and time for each frame is returned.
%     2 : Values for each pixel index are returned, and if
%            there are no values for that pixel then NaN
%            is returned at those indices.
%     3 : Mean value of each pixel is returned; no
%            individual frame data is recorded.  Any frames
%            w/o data or w/ NaN are excluded.  Time points
%            will be equal to the mean time recorded as well.
%     10: Individidual pixel values are returned, including
%           frames that only have partial data (i.e., when
%           scan is traversing the points to be read at the
%           beginning or end of an interval).
%     11: Mean data and time for each frame is returned,
%           including frames that have partial data.
%           (Note that this could mean that different numbers
%           of pixels are averaged during each frame.)
%     21: Mean data of all responses over all time intervals
%           is returned.
%
%  CHANNELS is the channel number to be read, from 1 to 2.
%  if there is one channel than tpreaddata_singlechannel will 
%  be called, if there are two channels then tpreaddata_single-
%  channel will be called twice (for ratiometric calcium imaging).

% 
%  DATA is an MxN cell list, where M is the number of time
%  intervals and N is the number of pixel regions specified.
%  T is also an MxN cell list that contains the exact sample
%  times of each point in DATA.
%
%  If there is a file in the directory called 'driftcorrect',
%  then it is loaded and the corrections are applied.
%  (See TPDRIFTCHECK.)
